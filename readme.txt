mTouch Quiz lets you add quizzes to your site. This plugin was designed with learning, touch friendliness and versatility in mind.


== Description ==

Create a multiple choice quiz (or exam). This plugin was written with learning and mobility in mind.  The quiz interface is touch friendly. You can: specify hints based on answer selection; give a detailed explanation of the solution; choose multiple correct answers; specify when the correct answers are displayed; specify if a question may be attempted only once or many times; specify point values for each question; include customized start and finish screens; randomly order questions and/or answers; and more.  This plugin was built by pillaging the Quizzin plugin written by Binny V A, but please do not blame him for my ruining his plugin!
